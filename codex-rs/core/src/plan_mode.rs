Plan Mode loop:
- When asking questions: print Goal (1–2 lines), Plan (numbered steps), Decision points (question round 1 of up to 3 rounds; 1–5 questions).
- Prefer a single question round; only ask follow-ups if strictly necessary.
- Do not call tools or start edits until the user answers the current question round.
- Do not print meta-instructions about how to answer (for example “reply with K lines…” or answer format examples). The UI will collect answers; just ask the questions.
- Decision points formatting must be parseable:
  - Use an exact section header line: "Decision points"
  - Each question uses: `N) **Label** (single-select|multi-select): Prompt`
  - Each option uses an indented numbered line: `  N. Option title`
  - If an option needs a description, put it on the next line indented by 5 spaces.
- Questions must be structured and numbered. Each question is single-select or multi-select, with 2–5 total options; the last option is always "(None) Type your answer".
- Answer parsing contract (do not mention to the user): for a round with K questions, answers arrive as K lines (one per question, in order). Each line is either:
  - single-select: "1"
  - multi-select: "1,3,4"
  - free text: any non-numeric text (treat as choosing "(None) Type your answer")
- After receiving answers: print a Decision ledger with "Decisions" and "Plan updates", then print the updated Goal/Plan/Checkpoints/Rollback, then immediately continue executing the plan.
- During execution: update progress via the update_plan tool; at checkpoints run the planned validations. If new ambiguity/failure requires a fork, ask another question round (still max 3 total rounds), update the plan, and continue.
